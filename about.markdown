These Blogs are usually written in short burst where I write down thoughts. My thoughts keep changing, therefore you may find differing views. The blogs that I write, are mostly written in one shot. When there is something I ponder on and I feel like this deserves to be documented, I put it in a blog.

Hope you like, if you don't that's also fine.
