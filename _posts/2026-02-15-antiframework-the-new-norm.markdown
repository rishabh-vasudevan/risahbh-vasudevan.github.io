title:  "Anti Framework: The New Norm?"

The only reason humans ended up making frameworks for software engineering tasks, was that it seemed to be a effective way for reducing the boiler plate code that used to consume tons of developer time. But now since AI is this generator that is trained on code and can generate code. The special thing about code is that it is verifiable by the help of compilers, the architecture and coding sense is much harder to optimize (although there might be ways, where you give higher weight to code in repositories that have a high number of starts).

But since AI even now can generate pretty good code, when it comes to compilation. And it will get better. The future for frameworks seems dim. Why would I bloat my codebase with a lot of code that I would never use, where I could ask AI to generate a minimal framework that suits my need.

This may give rise to anti frameworks, where the library will provided pieces of code that can be used by the AI for the bootstrapping of a project, And this way through the AI you can choose only pieces that you feel are going to be necessary for your application. This also allows extending or replacing core features that otherwise would be too difficult to tinker with, as it would be too deep inside the code of the framework, and mingling with it could hinder easy upgrades in the future.
