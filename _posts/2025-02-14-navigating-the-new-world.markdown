I am coming back after a long time. A lot has happened since my last blog. I finished college and since then have been working in the blockchain domain. Large language models became a reality around 3 years back, and they have been getting better since then. These models went from not able to import a single library correctly to being able to help with math research at the frontier.

These models bring a lot of promise with them. These promises being that we may be able to cure cancer, and do a lot more research as humans, or maybe rather for humans.I am not sure if we would be able to get a general intelligence like a human just by scalling these transformer based models, and by feeding it more and more data. These models do very well on things that can be verified, like programming and math where the verifiers are the compilers and the lean programming language.

So today we are in an interesting space, where if you tell the model to do something in code, it is able to and perform that in a lot of cases, which then leads to people just giving out a specification of a product and the AI model goes ahead and makes it happen. But what this has lead to, is people building thing without the context of the underlying thing. Earlier it used to take a lot of effort to go and try and perform a new thing, now it is virtually free, because the agent does it.

So for now I am going to be using the agents in a way where I won't allow anything to go into code that I don't understand, I either understand what it has done, or it gets reverted. I believe this is the correct technique at least for now. Maybe in the future when the models get a lot better, then I can start approving code that I don't understand, but even the thought of a day like that makes me feel uneasy. Because once something like that is possible that will become the norm instantly, as human beings are very lazy creatures.

This space is very exciting and lets see what happens in the future. Does it lead to infinite progress or does it lead to the doom of humanity.
