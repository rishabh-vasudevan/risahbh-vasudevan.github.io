Since the direction of most AI progress in 2026 is looking like it  is pointing towards scalling these transformer models. These models are pretrained on enormous amounts of data and then fine tuned to serve the data in a human consumable format. So meaning that the model already has digested a whole lot of data about the world and its working in pre-training.

Neural network training is almost like training a dog, you give it punishment when it goes wrong and then reward it when it goes right. The punishment or reward could be through Reinforcement Learning, or through a loss function that drastically changes the model itself and coerces it to give the wanted output.

By doing this, and by throwing unimaginable amounts of compute, power and data. We have reached the current state of the art models. So these models have digested so much of human data, almost any factoid or any concept can be given in one shot to them. But for now there is no goal that the AI can follow.

I don't think we are at the singularity yet. Though some people may argue against it, but I don't think the models right now can make drastic improvements to themselves right now without a human in the loop. But someday when the model is sufficiently strong, maybe in 2 years, or in a 100 years, There will come a day where a system starts improving itself, and then the growth will be truly super exponential. And I wonder will all of that insane progress start from a single prompt. What would that prompt look like? What will it say?
